This is a temperature controller PCB design that allows for precise temperature control with the following features:

1. 🌡️ Displays the current temperature value.
2. 🎯 Displays the desired temperature value.
3. ⬆️⬇️ Two buttons to raise and lower the temperature.
4. 🔌 Accepts a supply voltage of 100-240V AC.
5. 📶 Bluetooth communication.
6. 🌡️ Allows for the use of thermocouple and PT100 type sensors.


<h1>Usage</h1>

To use the temperature controller, follow these steps:

1. Connect the temperature controller to a power source using a 100-240V AC power supply.
2. Connect the desired temperature sensor to the temperature controller.
3. Set the desired temperature using the up and down buttons.
4. Monitor the current temperature on the display.
